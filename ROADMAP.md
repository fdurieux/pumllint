# pumllint roadmap

Status baseline: **v0.5.0** (2026-07-22) shipped the complete SCORING.md
maturity model — scorer, gap reports, `score --min-level` CI gate, integrity
caps C1–C7, XD cross-diagram pack — calibrated (SCORING.md §9), frozen behind
golden tests, and empirically characterized (EVIDENCE.md: fidelity
correlation r ≈ 0.49, sharp degradation below Level 2). **v0.6.0**
(2026-07-23) added Arc A's model-set aggregate score and Arc B's
baseline/ratchet mode; **v0.7.0** (2026-07-23) added trend/delta reporting
and the shields.io badge; **v0.8.0** (2026-07-23) added the composite GitHub
Action and pre-commit hooks; **v0.9.0** (2026-07-23) opened Arc C with the
class-diagram parser and CLS pack; **v0.10.0** (2026-07-23) added the
state-diagram parser and STA pack; **v0.11.0** (2026-07-23) closed the
original base catalog with UC003; **v0.12.0** (2026-07-23) thickened
DIM-TRC/DIM-RDB (GEN006–009, SEQ011) and settled the weight revisit
(unchanged, SCORING.md §9); **v0.13.0** (2026-07-23) finished Arc C with
cross-type entity identity (XD004–005 — 42 base rules); **v0.14.0**
(2026-07-24) extended the calibration corpus and golden contract to every
diagram type (additive re-freeze, 49 → 83 units). This file tracks what
remains, grouped into arcs. Keep it updated as items land.

## Arc A — Integrity (done)

- [x] **Model-set aggregate score** *(0.6.0)* — `aggregate_scores()` folds
  per-diagram results into a `ModelSetResult` (worst level +
  element-weighted composite, SCORING.md §3); text and json reporters emit
  it. `--min-level` gates on the model-set level by construction (set level
  = worst diagram level).

## Arc B — Trust & adoption (highest-value next arc)

- [x] **Baseline/ratchet mode** *(0.6.0)* — `pumllint score --baseline
  maturity.json` records per-diagram levels on first run, then fails CI only
  on *regression*; `--update-baseline` accepts the status quo
  (`pumllint/baseline.py`).
- [x] Trend/delta reporting *(0.7.0)* — ratchet-compare runs annotate the
  text report ("Level 3 → 4 since last baseline", "new since baseline") per
  diagram and for the model set; json adds `baseline: {level, delta}`.
- [x] Badge output *(0.7.0)* — `-f badge` emits shields.io endpoint JSON for
  the model-set level (SVG deemed unnecessary: shields renders styling from
  the endpoint; revisit only on demand).
- [x] Packaging *(0.8.0)*: composite GitHub Action (`action.yml`, inputs
  mirroring the CLI, installs from the pinned ref) and pre-commit hooks
  (`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`: `pumllint`, `pumllint-score`); both dogfooded
  in tests.yml and drift-guarded by tests/test_packaging.py.
- [ ] HTML report (single self-contained file) for architect-facing reviews.

## Arc C — Coverage growth

- [x] **CLS pack + class-diagram parser** *(0.9.0)* — `parser/class_.py`
  (classifiers, brace-body members, relations with multiplicities; typed by
  classifier declarations and `<|` generalization arrows, never re-typing
  other forms) + CLS001–005. Note: the corpus still has no class-diagram
  fixtures, so the golden contract does not yet cover CLS scoring — extend
  `tools/gen_corpus.py` and re-freeze deliberately when it should.
- [x] **STA pack + state-diagram parser** *(0.10.0)* — `parser/state.py`
  (declarations, composite bodies with a container stack, `[*]` endpoints;
  typed by the `state` keyword and `[*]`, never re-typing other forms) +
  STA001–003. Same corpus caveat as CLS: no state fixtures in the golden
  contract yet.
- [x] UC003 *(0.11.0)* — usecase links now carry label/arrow (`UseCaseLink`,
  tuple-unpack compatible), endpoints typed by syntax (`(X)` usecase, `:X:`
  actor), reversed arrows normalized; direction judged via actor
  connectivity, only when exactly one endpoint is actor-connected.
- [x] **Thicken DIM-TRC** *(0.12.0)* — GEN006 owner-tag + GEN007
  requirement-link, both convention-gated (dormant until the project
  configures its `pattern` — an always-on tag requirement would demote every
  diagram below the L5 dimension gate by fiat); parser gained
  header/footer/caption directives as tag carriers. Weight revisit settled:
  unchanged, signal-proportional (SCORING.md §9, v0.12.0 bullet).
- [x] **Thicken DIM-RDB** *(0.12.0)* — SEQ011 max-messages (default 30),
  GEN008 note-density (≥4 notes and >0.5/element), GEN009 max-elements
  (default 60, any type). Tail guards: no calibration-corpus unit trips
  them, so golden scores were unchanged (verified, no re-freeze).
- [x] Grow DIM-CON into cross-*type* entity identity *(0.13.0)* — XD004
  cross-type-name-collision and XD005 cross-type-stereotype-conflict span
  sequence/use-case participants, class classifiers and activity swimlanes
  (state names excluded on purpose: modes, not entities). Sequence-internal
  conflicts stay XD002/XD003's territory — no double reporting. Golden is
  structurally immune (corpus units score one diagram at a time; cross rules
  need ≥ 2).

## Arc D — Evidence engine (core done; optional deepening)

EVIDENCE.md delivered the measured maturity→codegen relationship. Only if
marketing claims need escalation:

- [ ] Complexity-normalized fidelity (kills the synthetic-diagram confound
  where trivial diagrams score near-perfect fidelity regardless of maturity).
- [ ] More scenario families beyond order_payment/credit_intake; larger n
  per diagram (current n=3 leaves ±8 noise on per-diagram means).
- [ ] Multiple generator and judge models (current: Opus 4.8 gen, Sonnet 5
  judge; remember the ~15-point self-judging bias — always judge
  independently).

## Arc E — Ecosystem (demand-driven; wait for pull)

- [ ] `pumllint fix` — auto-remediation for mechanical findings (declare
  implicit participants, add titles, name diagrams).
- [ ] LSP server / IDE integration for inline findings.
- [ ] JSON schema for the report formats (lint + maturity).
- [ ] Real SonarQube plugin with measures (replacing the synthetic-issue
  workaround in the sonar reporter).

## Working agreements (read before picking anything up)

- Scores are a public contract: any change that shifts corpus scores must be
  deliberate — the golden test enforces it; re-freeze consciously with
  `python tools/calibrate.py --freeze tests/golden_scores.json`.
- Claim language is settled (SCORING.md §9): Level 5 is "method-convention
  complete", never "guaranteed generation-ready"; the evidence-backed pitch
  is the correlation and the below-Level-2 cliff.
- The zero-dependency promise holds: product code and its tests must run
  under `python tests/run_tests.py` with the stdlib only.
- Recommended next: **Arc C is complete** (0.13.0), and the golden contract
  now covers every diagram type (0.14.0: class/state/usecase mutation
  ladders + per-type clean probes, additive re-freeze 49 → 83 units).
  Open threads, all demand-driven: Arc B's HTML report (architect-facing;
  wait for pull), Arc D evidence deepening (only if marketing claims need
  escalation), Arc E ecosystem (wait for pull).
